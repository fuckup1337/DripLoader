# DripLoader (PoC)
Evasive shellcode loader for bypassing event-based injection detection, without necessarily suppressing event collection (still added direct syscalls, just so I don't have to deal with AV). The project is aiming to highlight limitations of event-driven injection identification, and show the need for more advanced memory scanning and smarter local agent software inventories in EDR.

## DripLoader evades common EDRs by:
- using the most risky APIs possible like `NtAllocateVirtualMemory` and `NtCreateThreadEx`
- blending with call arguments, vendors are forced to drop most by default, or log but can't detect
- avoiding multi-event correlation by introducing delays 

## What does DripLoader do
- Identifies a base address suitable for our payload
- Reserves enough `AllocationGranularity` (64kB) sized, `NO_ACCESS` memory segments at the base address
- Loops over those
    - Allocating `PageSize` (4kB) sized, writable segments
    - Writing shellcode
    - Reprotecting as `RX`
- Overwrites prologue of one `ntdll` function in the remote process memory space with a `jmp` to our base
- Drops a thread on that trampoline 

## And so
- It's able to bypass Defender ATP VM allocation alerting, and others. I'll explain the thinking behind each step in a blog post comming end of the week.
- Bypasses simple thread-centric scanners like `Get-InjectedThread`. Persisting within a process is another story, and this is up to the payload author. 
- It is `sRDI`-compatible, but if your payload creates another local thread you will lose the benefit of thread start address in `ntdll`.

To test it out of the box
- compile/download
- XOR your binary shellcode blob file with default key 0x08
- run it and follow the prompts or ./DripLoader.exe <target_pid> <delay_per_step_ms>
